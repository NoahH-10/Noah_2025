<p style="font-size: 20px;">My Tools Setup</p> /* Might Change title if just writing a continuous story */

## The Beginning 

Intially, I chose to use my chromebook for this class. I started with creating a GitHub and Slack account, and joining the AP CSP server. Afterwards, I created a Kasm account and downloaded Kasm on my chromebook. At first, I struggled to find what I was supposed to do because I did not read the setup page that told me what to run. After reading the setup page, I obtained the Portfolio-2025 repository and ran the commands necessary to download the developer tools. With the Portfolio_2025 repository and the developer tools downloaded, I ran the version checks for ruby, bundle, python, and jupyter. I then cloned the student_2025 repository and renamed it to my name. I started working on my "home" and "about me" pages. Then, Kasm went down for all users, and when it came back up, everything I had done was gone. I lost my repositories and my developer tools and was back to square one, technically square two as I still had Kasm downloaded. After repeating the same process, a lot quicker this time, I continued to work on my pages, but then disaster struck once again. One day after school, when I was attempting to catch up on work at home, almost all of my files disappeared when I opened my chromebook, including my _config.yml, index.md, and Makefile. However, everything was not lost, as it was only my Kasm folder that did not have the data, the folders were still in the GitHub repository on the GitHub website.

## The Change

As the week ended, I was frustrated and over Kasm, which kept going down, not allowing me to work. I decided to use another computer that was more reliable, so I went home and started setting up a MacBook Pro that used to belong to my sister. To start the setup of my MacBook, I returned to the setup page and read the instructions on how to install the developer tools carefully. I downloaded VSCode, installed homebrew, and made my nighthawk directory. I ran the commands that gave me the developer tools, and I cloned my repository that I had been working on with my chromebook, so not all of my progress was lost. Now that I had a computer that I was able to work with, I started to try and catch up on my website pages over the weekend. To be continued ...
