    "The purpose of our groups project is _______. The purpose of my books adaptation page is to allow users to see whether or not a book has been made into a movie, which is a common question for many when starting a book. Users can also suggest a book to be added to the static list of books that have been made into movie adapations. Our groups Kanban board is linked here: ADD LINK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "On my frontend page \"Book Adaptation Checker\", users can click a button to make the table of books visible. Above that button is another button and box for users to input a book name that will be added to the table. On the table itself, there are two buttons, \"Update\" and \"Delete,\" which allows users to rename a book if they spelled it incorrectly or delete a book if it is either already on the static list, isn't a book that has been made into a movie, or has been added to the static list.\n",
    "\n",
    "User can click the button \"List of Books\" to show the table from the backend on frontend\n",

    "\n",
    "User can input a book name into the box and click \"Create\" to add it to the table on the frontend and backend. (I created the book \"Fahrenheit 451\")\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/Create.png\" alt=\"Create\">\n",
    "\n",
    "User can click \"Delete\" to delete a book from the table and \"Update\" to rename a book (I updated \"A Wrinkle in Time\" to \"A Crease in the 5th Dimension\" and deleted \"Fahrenheit 451\")\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/UpdateAndDelete.png\" alt=\"UpdateAndDelete\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The user input can also be simulated without the frontend, by using postman.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a \"GET\" request, I can retrieve all the books and their ids in from the backend.\n",

    "\n",

    "- The function generate_data() is defined in main.py, and has the initialization function for each table, which is defined in each individual model file, which contains the default data that is called\n",

    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/db_restore.png\" alt=\"Restoring\">\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",

    "- This command contains a restore command for each table it restores, for example, mine is \"_ = Book.restore(data.get('books', []))\"\n",
    "- Each model file has defines their restore function, which is a static method (meaing it can be called on the class itself without needing an instance), and goes through the data and (mine specifically) checks if a book with the given title already exists in the database using a query\n",
    "- Then, if the book exsists, it updates its data, and if it doesn't it create a new Book instance using the provided data\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/db_backup.png\" alt=\"Backing up\">\n",

    "How it works:\n",
    "- It runs the backup_data command, which is defined in main.py; it runs three distinct functions, extract_data(), save_data_to_json(), and backup_database()\n",
    "- extract_data() gathers the data from the tables and returns it as a dictionary\n",
    "- save_data_to_json() saves the extracted data into JSON files in the \"backup\" folder (for example, mine is called books.json)\n",
    "- backup_database() creates a backup file of the user_management.db file called user_management_bak.db by copying it (shutil.copyfile())\n",
