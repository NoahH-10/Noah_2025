    "## Explanation of how I Format JSON Data into the DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetching JSON Data**:\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/a.png\" alt=\"idk\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parsing JSON Data**:\n",
    "   - After fetching the data, I parse the JSON response using \"response.json()\". This converts the JSON string into a JavaScript object, making it easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clearing Existing Content**:\n",
    "   - Before inserting new data, I clear any existing rows in the table to ensure the displayed data is fresh and accurate with the code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   tableBody.innerHTML = ''; // Clear existing rows\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating HTML Elements**:\n",
    "   - Then I loop through the array of book objects from the JSON data and create a new table row (\"<tr>\") for each book. Within each row, I create cells (\"<td>\") for the book's ID, title, and action buttons (Update and Delete).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/b.png\" alt=\"idk\">\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Appending to the DOM**:\n",
    "   - Finally, each constructed row is appended to the table body, effectively updating the DOM with the new data with the code snippet:\n",

    "### Overview of Data Extraction Using Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using SQLAlchemy for Database Queries**:\n",
    "   - My application employs SQLAlchemy which allows me to interact with the database using Python objects and queries instead of raw SQL.\n",
    "   - For example, in the \"extract_data\" function in main.py, I use SQLAlchemy queries to retrieve all records from various models (e.g., \"User\", \"Section\", \"Group\", etc.):\n",

    "   - The \"extract_data\" function encapsulates the logic for querying the database and returns a structured dictionary containing all relevant data. This is done within the application context (\"with app.app_context():\") to ensure that the database session is properly managed.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: The \"post\" method expects a JSON object in the request body containing the book title. If the request is malformed (missing title), it returns a 400 status code with an error message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Return Type**: The responses are formatted as JSON using \"jsonify\", providing clear and structured data for the client. Successful creation returns the new book details along with a 201 status code:\n",
