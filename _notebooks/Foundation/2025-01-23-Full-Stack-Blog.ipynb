Users can also suggest a book to be added to the static list of books that have been made into movie adapations. Our groups Kanban board is linked here and contains our user stories and tasks.\n",

    "### 2. Code Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `BookAPI` class, the `get()` method retrieves all book records:\n",

    "- **Example Response**:\n",

    "## Explanation of how I Format JSON Data into the DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetching JSON Data**:\n",
    "   - I initiate data retrieval from my backend using the \"fetch\" API. For example, when the user clicks the \"List of Books\" button, it makes an asynchronous request to the API endpoint that returns the book data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/a.png\" alt=\"idk\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parsing JSON Data**:\n",
    "   - After fetching the data, I parse the JSON response using \"response.json()\". This converts the JSON string into a JavaScript object, making it easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clearing Existing Content**:\n",
    "   - Before inserting new data, I clear any existing rows in the table to ensure the displayed data is fresh and accurate with the code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   tableBody.innerHTML = ''; // Clear existing rows\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating HTML Elements**:\n",
    "   - Then I loop through the array of book objects from the JSON data and create a new table row (\"<tr>\") for each book. Within each row, I create columns (\"<td>\") for the book's ID, title, and action buttons (Update and Delete).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/fullstackblog/b.png\" alt=\"idk\">\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Appending to the DOM**:\n",
    "   - Finally, each constructed row is appended to the table body, effectively updating the DOM with the new data with the code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   tableBody.appendChild(tr);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handling User Actions**:\n",
    "   - Buttons for updating and deleting books are dynamically created. When clicked, they trigger corresponding functions that handle the necessary operations, ensuring that the UI remains in sync with the backend data."

    "     - It iterates over the \"data\" dictionary passed to the method, checking if each key corresponds to an attribute of the \"Book\" class. If it does, it updates the attribute using \"setattr\".\n",

    "- **Sequencing**: The method executes a sequence of actions to process a book creation request: fetching the JSON data, validating the input, checking for duplicates, and attempting to create a new book.\n",
    "- **Selection**: The method uses conditional statements (if-else) to check for required fields, handle existing books, and catch exceptions during book creation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Parameters and Return Type\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: The \"post\" method expects a JSON object in the request body containing the book title. If the request is malformed (missing title), it returns a 400 status code with an error message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Return Type**: The responses are formatted as JSON using \"jsonify\", providing clear and structured data for the client. Successful creation returns the new book details along with a 201 status code:\n",
