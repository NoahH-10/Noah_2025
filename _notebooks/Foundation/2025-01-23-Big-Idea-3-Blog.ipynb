    "## Big Idea 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Idea 3 in AP CSP emphasizes data and its various representations and manipulations. It covers essential concepts like variables, data abstraction, mathematical expressions, strings, boolean expressions, conditionals, iteration, developing algorithms, and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Variables and Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variables and assignments has been foundational in my programming experience. Variables serve as storage locations for data, allowing creation of dynamic programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `bookadaptation.py`, I use variables to manage the API responses and process user queries. For example, when searching for a movie, `found_movie` stores the result in a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@bookadaptation_api.route('/movies/search', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def search_movie():\n",
    "    title = request.args.get('title') \n",
    "    movies = load_movies()\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "    found_movie = next((movie for movie in movies if movie['title'].lower() == title.lower()), None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the variable `found_movie` holds the result of the search, demonstrating how we can manipulate and access data dynamically based on user input. This ability to store and manage data efficiently is crucial for creating responsive applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction simplifies complex data structures, making programs easier to manage. In `bookadaptation.py`, I used a function to load movies, abstracting the file reading process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def load_movies():\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open('movies.json') as f:\n",
    "            return json.load(f)\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        return [], \"File not found.\"\n",
    "    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n",
    "        return [], \"Error decoding JSON.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function hides the details of file handling, allowing focus on utilizing the movie data elsewhere in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical expressions are essential for performing calculations within programs. For example, I calculate the total number of movies from a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@bookadaptation_api.route('/movies', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_movies():\n",
    "    movies = load_movies()\n",
    "    return jsonify(movies)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I can easily manipulate the data returned to compute statistics, such as the total number of movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are vital for handling text data. The `search_movie` function processes user input to search for a movie title:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "title = request.args.get('title')  # Get the title from the URL\n",
    "found_movie = next((movie for movie in movies if movie['title'].lower() == title.lower()), None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This string manipulation allows for case-insensitive searching, improving user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Boolean Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean expressions are critical for making decisions within programs. I use them to check if a movie was found:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if found_movie:  # If the movie is found, return it\n",
    "    return jsonify(found_movie)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return jsonify({'message': f'The movie \"{title}\" was not found.'}), 404\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic helps control the flow of the application based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals enable different actions based on specific criteria. `BookAPI` uses conditionals to validate user input when creating a new book:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not data or 'title' not in data:\n",
    "    return {'error': 'Title is required.'}, 400\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This check ensures that the application behaves correctly based on user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Nested Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested conditionals allow for more complex decision-making. In the `put` method of the `BookAPI`, I handle both updating a book and checking for existence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not book:\n",
    "    return {'error': 'Book not found.'}, 404\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By nesting conditionals, I ensure that the program logic handles multiple scenarios seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration is crucial for executing repetitive tasks efficiently. I often iterate over lists of movies or books. For example, to get all books in the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get(self):\n",
    "    books = Book.query.all()\n",
    "    return jsonify([book.read() for book in books])  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This use of iteration enables the function to process and return multiple entries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let’s approach 3.9 with a focus on a specific algorithm used in the application. Here’s a revised version:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.9 Developing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing algorithms is essential for breaking down tasks into manageable steps. One algorithm I implemented is the process for adding a new book to our database. Here’s an example within our `BookAPI` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def post(self):\n",
    "    data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    if not data or 'title' not in data:\n",
    "        return {'error': 'Title is required.'}, 400\n",
    "\n",
    "    existing_book = Book.query.filter_by(title=data['title']).first()\n",
    "    if existing_book:\n",
    "        return {'error': 'Book with this title already exists.'}, 400\n",
    "\n",
    "    new_book = Book(title=data['title'])\n",
    "    result = new_book.create()  # Use the create method\n",
    "    if result is None:\n",
    "        return {'error': 'Error creating book.'}, 500\n",
    "\n",
    "    return new_book.read(), 201  # Return the created book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By clearly outlining these steps, I ensure that the application handles book creation efficiently and accurately. This structured approach helps anticipate potential issues and streamline the coding process, ultimately leading to more reliable software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.10 Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are powerful data structures for storing collections of items. In `home.md`, I dynamically create tables to display book data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "data.forEach(book => {\n",
    "    const tr = document.createElement('tr');\n",
    "    idCell.innerText = book.id;\n",
    "    titleCell.innerText = book.title;\n",
    "    // Append to the table body\n",
    "    tableBody.appendChild(tr);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This JavaScript code showcases how I handle lists in the front end to present data interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Idea 3 in AP CSP has significantly enhanced my understanding of data and programming concepts. From variables and conditionals to algorithms and lists, these skills are foundational for my future studies and career in technology. Engaging with these concepts has not only improved my coding abilities but also equipped me with the analytical mindset necessary to tackle complex problems in any field I pursue."
