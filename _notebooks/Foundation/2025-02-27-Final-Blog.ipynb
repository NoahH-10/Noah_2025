    "[Feedback Issue](https://github.com/Ahaanv19/LitConnect/issues/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "We receieved a lot of constructive feedback, mainly from my dad and Weston dad, which I touch on in my future plans for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before and after my presentation of our website, I went to and review other people's sites. For example, I went to Weston and Justin's website about teaching binary that I found really interesting. I don't know binary, and niether do a lot of people, so their website would be helpful. It also doesn't just have information or teach people binary, but has games that facilitate learning and competitiveness and are customizable. Not only was the app interesting, but the group presented it really well, especially Justin.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also reviewed the website named Pawnsy, which was a chess platform where users could play against an AI. You could customize the difficulty level of the AI as well as save your game and analyze and review it. I also review the website Cantella (Xavier T. and Zafeer A.'s group) which was a study app for AP classes. You could click on different classes, like AP World or AP Chemistry, and find studying material as well as create your own flash cards that you can use."

    "## My Future in Computer Science\n",
    "\n",
    "I took this class to learn more about computer science, as it seemed like a logical elective given I needed to expand my horizons for college. From the very first lesson, I realized how much more there is to this field than just coding. We explored algorithms, problem-solving techniques, the fundamental principles that drive technology today, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class has opened doors for me that I never imagined possible. I’ve gained skills in critical thinking and collaboration through group projects, and I’ve learned how to approach complex problems with a systematic mindset. The knowledge I've acquired will undoubtedly be valuable in college, where I will delve deeper into computer science and related disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I have gained knowledge that prepares me for college by learning and implementing Agile and Scrum methodology. When college computer science students talked about their college experience, they told us how what they learned in AP CSP greatly prepared them for college assignments, and now I have gained that same knowledge."

    "\n",
    "After a lot of constructive feedback at Night at the Musuem, this project is far from over. Some of the next steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improving styling and coloring of website to look more modern than like a child colored it\n",
    "- Consolidate the features, there are way too many that do not really make sense\n",
    "    - For example, we have book recommenations, genre recommendations, reading tracker, local library suggestions, and an awards database. These have a lot in common and shouldn't be individual features.\n",
    "- On my book quotes feature, I should implement a likes system for the quotes and make it so users can save the quotes to a database in their profile\n",
    "- On my book adaptation feature, I should make the layout more clear, like when you search a book, it is a more definitive response instead of \"book\" not found. Maybe the search bar is on the left and on the right pulls up an image of the movie's cover and could lead to more details. The suggestion box should overshadow the rest of the website and make it look like its two seperate features of equal importance, the checker is the main feature, and suggestion box should be smaller\n",
    "- In the book tracker feature, instead of inputting a percent read, which requires users to calculate it themselves, make it so the feature calculates the percent for you\n",
    "- There are many constraints on the Login/Signup system that would be unbeknownst to users, we should add the requirements (like the ID is only numbers, username requires more than one letter, etc.)"

    "\n",
    "### Honest Self-Grade:\n",

    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "- 4.3/5 points: I will discuss 5 things I did over 12 weeks in the live review presentation, including issues and burndown lists on my Kanban board. I accomplished all requirements given to me, but feel that there is a lot of improvements for my website features and website as a whole.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- 1/1 point: I blogged my Book Adaptation Checker (Project Feature) and used language from the CPT requirements and FRQ\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1/1 point: I completed the 2020 MCQ and blogged my errors, what I need to learn more about, and steps I will take to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1/1 point: In my Final Blog, I discuss three other website presentations I saw and what I found interesting. I reflected on my future in Computer Science, future plans for my website, and individual strengths and weaknesses. I also did a practice live review with three other students from different periods and projects to prepare for Monday's live review (Elliot Y, Zafeer A, and Johan M). I have also sent you this honest self-grade and a summary of what I will discuss in my Live Review on Monday."
