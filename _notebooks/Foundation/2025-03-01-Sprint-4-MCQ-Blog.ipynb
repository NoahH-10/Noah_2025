    "# Multiple Choice Question Exam Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "## What did I learn from the Quiz?\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the 2020 multiple-choice questions exam for AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) tested my knowledge and demonstrated to me how well I understood the course concepts. The exam taught me the basics on how to analyze date and make decisions using that data, required me to use problem-solving skills and creative thinking to challenge complicated problems or ones that I did not understand, and displayed how concepts from AP CSP are used in the real world.\n",

    "Based on these scores, I feel like I struggled more with questions that asked me to figure out code and some of the questions (Internet and Crowdsourcing) that regarded concepts I was unfamiliar with. This is similar to the previous MCQ, but I actually improved on the questions I was unfamiliar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.11 - Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/b.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C - A binary search will work on any sorted list, regardless of whether the list contains any duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.13 Devleoping Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/c.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B - The MaxFour procedure calculates a maximum of several values (similar to the MaxTwo and MaxThree procedures), but it does not generalize this functionality to calculate the maximum of any number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.17 - Algorithmic Efficiency \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/d.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D - Version I calls GetPrediction once for each element of idList, while version II calls GetPrediction twice for each element of idList (plus one more time at the end). Therefore, version II takes more than 1 minute longer than version I.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 - Nested Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/e.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B - This code segment initially sets cost to 6, then increases cost by 2 for people who are either going on a guided tour or whose age is greater than 12. Because of the ELSE statement, the cost is not properly set for people who are both older than 12 and going on a guided tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 - Crowdsourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/f.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D - The work may be distributed to amateur or nonprofessional individuals, who are not likely to have the same accuracy as the professional researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 - The Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/g.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B - IP addresses are hierarchical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 - Identifying and Correcting Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/h.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C - The given code segment inserts even elements from oldList at the beginning of newList, causing the elements to appear in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.12 - Calling Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/i.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: A - This code segment will draw four line segments: one with endpoints (2, 6) and (8, 6), one with endpoints (2, 6) and (8, 4), one with endpoints (2, 6) and (8, 2), and one with endpoints (2, 6) and (8, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.6 - Safe Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/j.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D - Certificate authorities do not verify the safety of Web sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 - Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2/k.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: A - Statement II is false. The simulation displays the change in population over the entire course of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of taking this exam was to demonstrate my knowledge of the course concepts of AP Computer Science Principles. In order to further my understanding and knowledge, I will watch the provided videos on each of the questions I got wrong.\n",
